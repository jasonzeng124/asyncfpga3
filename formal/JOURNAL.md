# Formal feasibility journal

## 2026-10-27 -- branch created
Branched from claude/research at 3dc25ad. Program in formal/PROGRAM.md.

## Session Tue Oct 27 02:37:59 UTC 2026 (shard A, lead)
### progress 02:37
Lock taken (was epoch/none). Machine: 4 cores, 15 GB RAM, no swap. Starting track 1 (toolchain).
### progress 02:44
Toolchain. Blocked by the proxy (403): release.lean-lang.org (elan downloads),
Reservoir (lake's package lookup), cache.mathlib.org and
lakecache.blob.core.windows.net (Mathlib's prebuilt oleans). Workarounds:
Lean 4.35.0 from the GitHub release zip linked into elan; Mathlib v4.35.0 by
git URL in lakefile.toml; Mathlib built from source, but only the modules the
project imports (lake builds the transitive closure only). PROGRAM.md says
never build from source unless the cache fails: it fails.
- formal/slot.sh: flock semaphore, default slots = min(nproc-1, (memGB-2)/4)
  = 3 here. A `lake build` holds one slot but uses all cores; only the shard
  lead runs it.
- formal/check.sh: builds every module under formal/lean/Formal/ (lakefile
  globs Formal.+), a textual scan for sorry/admit/native_decide/axiom, then an
  axiom audit: every declaration in a Formal.* module, via collectAxioms, may
  use only propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound (sorryAx and
  Lean.ofReduceBool fail it). Unproved work goes in formal/lean/Wip/ (not built).
- Import policy (to keep the from-source build small): import specific Mathlib
  modules, never `import Mathlib`.
### progress 02:48
11 shard-A probes launched as subagents: trace (ℝ, event list, discrete; common benchmark B0-B5), circuit layer + event/ℝ bridge, delay (pure, inertial, involution), Kleene LUT (INIT semantics, shared Core API), LUT mux-tree fidelity theorem, primitive fidelity table, literature x2. Mathlib subset builder running (lead only); probes ask for modules in Wip/REQUESTS.txt. Draft PR #3 opened.
### progress 02:59
check.sh hardened: per-file mode (`formal/check.sh Formal/X.lean ...`, used while
other probes' files are mid-edit); comment-aware textual scan (formal/scan.py);
audit imports Lean. Negative controls run: a sorryAx hidden from the scan fails
the audit (`negctl_sorry uses sorryAx`); native_decide fails both the scan
and the audit (`..._native.native_decide.ax_1_1`); a clean rfl theorem passes.
Bug found and fixed on the way: with pipefail, a failing `lean` made the
`| grep error && fail=1` branch never run -- the check could not fail. 
Claimed (check.sh OK, audit only propext/choice/Quot.sound):
- Formal/Core/Delay/Pure.lean (47 decls): bounded FIFO transport channel as a
  retiming relation; series composition is EXACTLY the sum band
  (chan_comp_iff); pulse width bounds w±(hi-lo); a pulse can vanish iff
  w ≤ hi-lo (pulse_vanish_iff); bundling lemma bundle_two_wires
  (ts + hiD ≤ loR). Open in Wip: event-list adequacy; bounded-skew variant.
- Formal/Core/LutTree.lean (core Lean only): mux-tree Kleene eval equals the
  INIT-table Kleene semantics for every k, INIT, K3 vector
  (evalTree_eq_tableEval); tree order irrelevant for the Kleene function
  (evalTree_swap); timed tree with arbitrary per-mux delays: single input
  change with equal endpoint values is glitch-free (sic_glitch_free) under two
  named hypotheses H_mux_kleene, H_sram; two-input changes across a function
  hazard glitch, order-dependently. Finding: research GLS's SLICE_LUTX builds
  the tree with A6 at the leaves (silicon: A6 at the root, per UG474); harmless
  for Kleene values, differs in timing.
Literature notes A-lit-1 (40 sources), A-lit-2 (Graphiti, Lean 4 Dynamatic
dataflow, ASPLOS'26; ACL2 link-joint async proofs; Lutsig HOL4 7-series LUT).
