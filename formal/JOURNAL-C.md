# Shard C journal (composition, ring, timing checker, netlist import, other tools)

## Verdicts (shard C)

(pending: tracks 8-12 in progress)

## Session Tue Oct 27 02:58:16 UTC 2026

### progress 02:58
Took LOCK-C (was epoch/none). A's setup.sh exists; running it (Lean 4.35.0 +
Mathlib from source). Next: Formal/Net/Prelim.lean and probes for tracks 8-12.

### progress 03:02
Lean 4.35.0 up (A's setup.sh; Mathlib still building from source). Toolchain
cache restore (cloud/toolchain-cache.sh fetch, key d7ce266cff0c8e1e) running;
needed zstd from apt first. Net/Prelim committed (Nat-ps traces, as shard B).
11 probes launched: 8a Handshake (protocol-level assume-guarantee FIFO),
8b Kahn (token semantics, determinacy, gcd = C gcd), 8c Muller (gate-level
LUT C-element chain; SI exhaustive check fallback), 9a Ring (why 3 stages,
proved or refuted), 9b RingCheck (verified min-cycle checker vs emit.py),
10a Timing checker (interval STA sound + exactness), 10b rules E/A/J
(semantics, counterexamples), 11a yosys JSON -> Lean, 11b FASM -> Lean
(physical INIT after pin permutation), 12a SAT/SMT, 12b Workcraft/UPPAAL.
Probes compile with core Lean via slot.sh; only the lead builds.
