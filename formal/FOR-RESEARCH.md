# For research and the owner: THE goal (the gcd_hw bitstream theorem)

Started 2026-11-01 by shard A. Counterexamples to THE theorem go here first (PROGRAM.md). The older,
rule-by-rule list is `formal/out/FOR-RESEARCH.md`.

## 1. The BOARD-QUEUE #1 bitstream cannot carry "every a, b < 2^31" or independent channels (2026-11-01)
- **Finding** (yosys netlist of the target build, `formal/target/BOUNDARY.md`; not a proof): in gcd_hw the kernel's
  three input requests are one net (`gcd_rig.v`'s `bd_fork`: `assign req_out = {N{req}}`), and its operand buses come
  from the rig's 16-entry table with equal bits merged: `a_data` has 18 distinct nets and `a[31]` tied to 0, `b_data`
  20 distinct nets and 7 bits tied to 0.
- **Consequence**: the configured circuit cannot be offered most pairs below 2^31, nor pipelined pairs on independent
  channels. THE theorem is written (formal/lean/Wip/Target/Spec.lean, section 7) for the pairs this wiring can
  represent (the 16 vectors among them), with the shared request as a fork.
- **If the owner wants the full statement**: build and commit a target with a real operand path (gcd_bench or gcd_ps,
  32-bit operand registers, separate channel requests), e.g. as a BOARD-QUEUE item, and name it. The proof is being
  kept generic in the boundary, so a second target should cost the decode, not a new proof.
